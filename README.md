# Exchange Rate

We need to create an online service that gives the latest and historical exchange rate for the currency.

This web based Exchange Rate app is a full stack web based application built with React on the front-end and uses the node.js as the backend.

## Tech stack 

For this web app, I used:
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Not the first time I used react, I can say I've adpated to it quite nicely, I'm quite comfortable with it on using on my future web-based projects. Creating DOM elements + handling events is easier than say Angular 1/2.
 - [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) - I used this before on a few of my side projects and I feel very comfortable using it's components.
 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - This is the first time I've used Node.js on a project, people say it's fast because of how it handles multiple requests using single-threading. I never really had the chance to use this on a production level.
 - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - web framework that I used to create API endpoints 
 - [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) - I used this during development to run 2 node apps at the same time (back-end + front end)

## Recommendations

Well obviously this app needs some more work to make it fully functioning.
I think the following features will be some nice to add: 
 - Currency rate trend predictions
 - Subscription based alert - a guest signs up, subscribe to a currency, and will get alerts if there are major changes o na currency rate.
 
An improved UX will definitely be helpful of course.
